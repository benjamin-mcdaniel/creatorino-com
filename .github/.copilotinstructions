# How to Build Creatorino - Content Creator Analytics Platform

**Frontend (Cloudflare Pages)**: Build a lightweight React/Vue app with sidebar navigation, creator profile header, and vertical timeline component. Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design.

**Backend (Cloudflare Workers)**: Create API endpoints for data fetching, YouTube API integration, and CRUD operations. Use Hono.js framework for routing and middleware.

**Database Design (MongoDB)**: Use collection-per-creator approach: `creators` collection for profiles, `creator_analytics_{creatorId}` collections for individual timelines to handle thousands of entries efficiently.

**Data Structure**: Creator profile stores name, platforms, stats summary. Analytics collections store timestamped entries with metrics, descriptions, and platform sources.

**Timeline Component**: Build vertical timeline with date markers on left, expandable content cards on right. Implement virtualization for performance with large datasets.

**Authentication**: we will add after, use a demo setup

**API Endpoints**: we will create those later use demo data

**Deployment**: Frontend on Cloudflare Pages with automatic builds, Workers for API, MongoDB Atlas for database. Use Cloudflare KV for caching frequently accessed data.

**Future Scaling**: Design plugin system for new platforms (Twitch, TikTok). Each platform gets its own data fetcher worker and standardized data format for timeline consistency.

**Performance**: Implement pagination for timeline (load 50 entries at a time), cache creator stats in KV store, use MongoDB indexes on creatorId and timestamp fields.

**MVP Launch**: Start with manual creator onboarding, YouTube-only data, basic timeline and stats. Add user submissions and new platforms post-launch based on feedback.

**framework** use vue and minimal packages, if one option is possible use it for multiple solutions. do not use multiple css solutions. 

**terminal** && doesnt work in the terminal.
